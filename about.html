              <h1>Early Life</h1>
              <p>Srinivasa Ramanujan was born in Erode, Tamil Nadu, India.</p>

              <h1>Early Education and Self-Study</h1>
              <p>
                Ramanujan showed an early aptitude for mathematics, exploring
                concepts on his own and developing his own theorems. Due to
                financial constraints, he faced challenges in pursuing formal
                education, but he continued to study mathematics independently.

              <h1>Discovery of Pi Formulas</h1>
              <p>
                Ramanujan independently discovered formulas to calculate the
                mathematical constant pi (Ï€), which are now known as Ramanujan's
                pi formulas.

              <h1>Correspondence with Hardy</h1>
              <p>
                Ramanujan's mathematical work came to the attention of the
                British mathematician G.H. Hardy through a letter with samples
                of his theorems. Hardy recognized Ramanujan's genius and invited
                him to England to further explore his mathematical ideas.

              <p>
                Ramanujan moved to Cambridge, England, to collaborate with G.H.
                Hardy at the University of Cambridge. He faced challenges in
                adjusting to the English academic environment but continued to
                produce groundbreaking work

              <h1>Scholarships and papers published</h1>
              <p>
                Ramanujan was awarded a Bachelor of Science degree by research
                (Ph.D. equivalent) for his work on highly composite numbers. He
                became a Fellow of the Royal Society, a prestigious honor for
                his contributions to mathematics.

              <h1>Health Challenges and Return to India</h1>
              <p>
                Ramanujan's health deteriorated due to a combination of factors,
                including the climate and dietary changes in England. He
                returned to India in 1919 and continued his mathematical work,
                despite declining health.

              <p>
                January 26, 1920: Srinivasa Ramanujan passed away at the young
                age of 32 due to health complications. His notebooks contained a
                wealth of mathematical discoveries that continue to influence
                and inspire mathematicians to this day.
